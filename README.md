# Introducing a new chess opening - The Hokey Pokey

#Motivation
I have invented a new chess opening. It's called the "Hokey Pokey" opening. Through pacifistic repetition of knight moves the opponent is given ample tempo. Against engines/good players, this is a horrible strategy. However, I intend to explore the following interesting properties it presents:
- Non-Commital Position: Since I do not make a commital move far into the game, there is opportunity for the positions to reach very unique set-ups, or an over-extended opponent.

#Goals
- Play some games with the opening (Lichess: HokeyPokerHero)
- Analyze commonalities in how the opponent responds
- Analyze results

#Predictions:
- Games until an opponent counter-Hokey-Pokies into a draw: Within first 300 games.


#Progress
5/15/22: 10 games played. 5W/5L/1217 (provisional) rating
